# Personal Website
This is a website I made using React to display my personal projects. See here: https://calebbrett.github.io/Portfolio/

### Why use React?
I could have made this website with pure HTML and CSS as it is not very complex. However, I wanted to use this as an oportunity to learn how to use React.
I took advantage of React by setting up the backend so that I have an array of project titles, descripitons and video file paths. This array is iterated through and converted into the final formatted project "blocks"  which get displayed to the viewer. This allows me to easily add new projects without needing to alter the base code of the website.
